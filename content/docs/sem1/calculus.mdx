# Calculus

## MAT1002

### Introduction

*Course code: MAT1002*

*Syllabus* : Module 1 :
(It is essentially Real Analysis at it's gist)
Differential Calculus: Functions of single variable: Review of limit, continuity and differentiability. Mean
value theorems: Rolle's theorem, Lagrange's theorem, Cauchy's theorem, Taylor's theorem, Taylor’s
and Maclaurin series.

Module 2: 
Partial Differentiation: Partial derivatives, Euler’s Theorem, chain rule, total derivative, Jacobians,
Maxima, Minima for the functions of two variables.

Module 3: 
Vector Calculus: Scalar and vector fields, gradient of scalar point function, directional derivatives,
divergence and curl of vector point function, Line integral.

Module 4: 
Integral Calculus: Fundamental theorem of Integral calculus, mean value theorems, evaluation of
definite integrals, applications in area, length, volumes and surface of solids of revolutions, Improper
integrals: Beta and Gamma functions.

### How to start


### Lecture slides
No lecture slides are used for this course. All teaching is done using blackboard content and hands on practice.


### Handwritten notes

### PYQs


### Practice resources


It is preferred to do Solved Problems and exercises from B.S. Grewal and then solve problem sheet by RBU Math department. 
And if time permits then solve problems from H.K. Das exercises.
