The main inspiration for this site was from the visionary ideas of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) and [Paulo Coelho](https://x.com/paulocoelho/status/795429831030829056?lang=en).
The knowledge should not be considered as an Intellectual Property as unfettered access to information is a fundamental human right. 
As Maa Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and eloquence, symbolizes the flowing river of knowledge. Her association with the sacred Saraswati River metaphorically represents the continuous and unobstructed stream of wisdom that nurtures and enlightens minds. As the [Rigveda (10.75)](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc839377.html) praises, "Sarasvatī, the mighty flood—she with her light illuminates."
